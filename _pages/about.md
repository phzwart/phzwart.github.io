I am a computational biophysicist and machine learning researcher with over 20 years of experience at the intersection of AI, computational methods, structural biology, and autonomous experimentation. I am currently a Staff Scientist at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/), where I lead ML and computational programs in life and imaging sciences.

My work focuses on developing accountable and reliable AI systems for scientific applications, with particular emphasis on **uncertainty quantification**, **conformal prediction**, and **adaptive control** for experimental facilities. I am passionate about creating AI systems that scientists can trust to make critical decisions in high-stakes experimental environments.

## Current Research Focus

I lead Activity 3 of the [LAMBDA project](https://www.als.lbl.gov/lambda/), developing federated AI-ready data infrastructure across DOE facilities. I also work on foundation models for scientific imaging through the SYNAPS-I (reSIFT) project funded by NIH.

My methodological research centers on:
- **Conformal Prediction**: Developing Small Sample Beta Correction (SSBC) for tight PAC guarantees in data-limited settings
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Operational rate estimation for accountable automation
- **Autonomous Experimentation**: Adaptive data acquisition achieving 20-100× efficiency gains

## Key Innovations

**Small Sample Beta Correction (SSBC)**: A novel approach to conformal prediction that provides tight PAC guarantees even in small-sample regimes, enabling accountable automation in scientific settings where data is expensive or limited. [arXiv:2509.15349](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15349)

**Conformalized Quantile Regression**: Framework for autonomous experiments combining quantile-based predictive control with conformal guarantees, with applications in hyperspectral imaging and mass spectrometry. [arXiv:2505.08176](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08176)
