## Research Areas

My research sits at the intersection of machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and scientific experimentation. I develop methods and systems that enable trustworthy AI-driven discovery in domains where data is expensive, decisions are consequential, and reliability is paramount.

### Conformal Prediction & Uncertainty Quantification

I develop rigorous uncertainty quantification methods based on conformal prediction, with emphasis on providing distribution-free, finite-sample guarantees for scientific decision-making.

**Key contributions:**
- Small Sample Beta Correction (SSBC): Tight PAC coverage guarantees for small-sample regimes
- Operational rate estimation for accountable automation
- Conformalized quantile regression for adaptive experimental control
- Evaluation frameworks for scientific model benchmarking

### Autonomous Experimentation

Developing adaptive control systems that achieve 20-100× efficiency gains in experimental data acquisition through intelligent sample selection and real-time decision-making.

**Applications:**
- Hyperspectral imaging with adaptive point selection
- Mass spectrometry with intelligent acquisition strategies
- Automated feature discovery in geobiology
- Real-time quality control at synchrotron beamlines

### Scientific Imaging & Deep Learning

Building foundation models and specialized deep learning systems for scientific image analysis across multiple modalities and scales.

**Focus areas:**
- Segmentation and anomaly detection for tomography
- Lattice light sheet microscopy analysis
- Electron microscopy image processing
- Representation learning for scientific imaging (SYNAPS-I/reSIFT)

### High-Performance Computing & Data Infrastructure

Leading large-scale infrastructure efforts connecting DOE facilities with advanced computing resources.

**Current initiatives:**
- LAMBDA: Federated AI-ready data infrastructure across DOE facilities
- Cross-facility workflows linking light sources with NERSC
- Exascale workflows for free-electron laser data analysis
- Out-of-core tensor processing (qlty) for constrained hardware

Novel methodology providing tight PAC coverage guarantees in small-sample settings. Enables accountable automation for toxicity screening, molecular property prediction, and structural biology applications.

### dlsia
**Deep Learning for Scientific Image Analysis**

ML toolkit for segmentation, anomaly detection, and analysis across tomography, lattice light sheet microscopy, and electron microscopy. Deployed at multiple DOE facilities and integrated into experimental pipelines.

### qlty
**Out-of-Core Tensor Processing**

Framework enabling efficient ML training and inference on memory-constrained hardware. Allows processing of datasets that exceed available RAM through intelligent chunking and caching strategies.

### Autonomous IR Spectroscopy
**Real-Time Adaptive Acquisition at Scale**

Developed real-time adaptive acquisition and evaluation pipelines for infrared spectroscopy at large-scale DOE facilities. Achieves significant efficiency gains through intelligent sample selection.

## Past Major Contributions

### Structural Biology & Crystallography

As Science Lead for the Berkeley Center for Structural Biology (2007-2015), I increased automation capacity by over 5× through computational optimization and developed Xtriage, now adopted by the Protein Data Bank for global crystallographic quality control.

**Key achievements:**
- Co-led peer-reviewed service crystallography program (>500 structures, including Nobel Prize-associated work)
- Developed algorithms for crystallographic pathology and twinning detection
- Built SAXS analysis pipelines with 10× speedup
- Core contributor to PHENIX and CCTBX infrastructure

### Free-Electron Laser Science

Developed exascale workflows for FEL scattering data analysis, dramatically boosting throughput and reconstruction speed for serial femtosecond crystallography and other FEL techniques.

## Collaborative Research

I maintain active collaborations across:
- Multiple DOE National Laboratories (LBNL, SLAC, ANL, BNL, ORNL)
- NIH-funded imaging initiatives
- Academic partners at UC Berkeley, Stanford, and international institutions
- Industry partners in biotechnology and materials science
